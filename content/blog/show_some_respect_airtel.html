Dear Airtel,

I have a very big problem with your right now. I have already spoken to your technical support
people and they have not resolved this issue for me.

# About me

I use your services everywhere. I have your landline, DSL, 3G plans & DTH. I highly respect your 
support services when it comes to landline, 3G and DSL (though your DTH support sucks bigtime).

*   I have subscribed to the best available home user plan you have on offer
*   I have paid for your smart data packages when I've crossed the limit

I am probably the ideal user that you had in mind.

# The problem

You hijack my connection to show a message. 

About my internet usage. 

Its not just once, its time limited. You show it for a minute or so.

For some reason, my modem disconnects frequently and I get to see this message more frequently
than you probably intended.

The larger problem, however, is that **you have no idea how serious of a disruption this is**. 
In my opinion, it is a suable offense. It is one of the gravest possible errors any company can make. 

Think of these:

-   A restuarant pouring salt in someone's food because they are ordering too much eventhough 
    they are paying for it. 
-   A postal service deciding to send a bill _instead_ of a telegram because the number of words is 
    _close_ to the maximum limit.
    
I get [this message]( {{ cover }} ) not when I am past due on my payments, not even when I have 
exhausted my upper limit. I get this message when I am at _80%_ of the upper limit of my 
**unlimited connection**. This time, I got this message **right after** I paid you for a smart 
bytes package.

## In layman's terms

I am going to assume that it seems innocuous to you because of ignorance. You think people 
are using their browsers to type URL's and that **is** how people use internet. Let me 
explain this in layman's terms using an analogy you might understand:

Let's say you are a water service provider. You have tubes to people's homes and they get water 
from those tubes. You have a [Fair Usage Policy][FUP] on water. When the user reaches 80% limit, 
you send them a long sheet of paper with the message attached to this post instead of water. You 
think its all good, assuming that people are always getting water out of taps in buckets or glasses 
or mugs. 

That's not how people use your service though. People have their water pipes connected to different 
things, like washing machines, coffee makers, water heaters, flushes, showers etc.., When you send 
that piece of paper, it damages their equipment. It breaks their lives. It makes them miserable.

# The internet and your role

We call the internet "the tubes" for a specific reason. It connects people and delivers information 
of many different kinds. As a user, I am paying you for access to those tubes. I trust that the 
information that is transferred between my home and the sources is uncorrupted, un-meddled-with and 
secure. Your behavior violates my trust.

My connections drop. When I am testing my code that is deployed on a server somewhere, it fails. I 
have to spend several minutes before I realize that its _because of you_. When I'm watching a pingu 
with my little boy, when the seagull is about to drop some white crap on pingu's head, the video stops. 
My little boy cries. _You made_ my little boy cry. 

**Don't do this. Please.**

# Hope

I am willing to pay more for higher limits as you can see with my smart bytes purchases. Don't penalize your
best customers. I hope that it is an honest mistake coming out of complete ignorance in your chosen field. I 
hope that you understand the seriousness of this issue and make amends. I have no other problems with your 
service. I sincerely hope that this issue won't make me switch from your otherwise excellent service.
