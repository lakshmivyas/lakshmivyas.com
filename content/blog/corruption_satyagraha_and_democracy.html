# Know thy enemy

When Gandhi used civil disobedience and satyagraha, he was fighting
the oppressors. He was fighting the people that controlled other
people against their wishes. He was fighting for democracy.

The Indian government, however inefficient, corrupt and non-progressive,
is nonetheless democratic.  The parliament debates on legislature, the
opposing views of the multi-party system allowing for healthy exchange of
perspectives ultimately coming up with laws that take into account those
view points.


# In order to find a solution, we need to understand the problem

In a democracy, subpar governance is penalized with retraction of power.
The people have the power to do it. The new government is responsible for
bringing the corrupt to justice if the older government failed to do so.
Its a balancing act. These opposing factions are supposed to police each
other to make sure the system is healthy. While this sounds good in theory,
it has not functioned very well in practice in India as well as
[other governments](http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results).

Yes, the Indian government is corrupt. Yes, India has lost a lot money to
government corruption. Yes, a whole bunch of politicians have lined their
coffers. Yes, these demand a change. The Lokpal bill proposed by the government
has its faults. No doubt. None. Is "Jan Lokpal" the answer though?

# For & Against -- Not a zero sum game

It is nice for people to have a voice. It is wonderful when people have an
opinion and take a stand. It is great for people to come together for a common
cause to make a city / state / country / the world better. But it is important
to have a good understanding.

"Hey oppressors from England, leave our country"

"Hey racist government. Black is just a color. We are all people."

These are absolutes. These are super simple. Clear.

"We want you to pass the Jan Lokpal bill as is."

Not so clear. Not so absolute. How do we know "Jan Lokpal" is the silver
bullet. What are the consequences? If the government passes the bill
without a healthy debate from either side is it good for the country? Is
there any way to guarantee that the "Jan Lokpal" is not going to be as
corrupt as todays government in the near or far term? How is it going
to affect the other processes?

Can the opposition parties use it to dethrone any government? If there
is little penalty for complaints, can the organization be rendered
incompetent by simply bombarding it with complaints? Can our not so friendly
neighbors use this to destabilize the government? What about conflict of
interest if the prime minister's office is under scrutiny?

These are big questions. Huge. Let us even ignore these questions.

# Who bells the big bad mouse that bells the big bad cat?

Government organizations are tightly controlled. There are links that
form a chain that bind the whole thing together. An organization to
collect complaints, provide protection, investigate corruption, decide
their budget etc.., without those links is another monolithic bureaucracy.
A government on top of the government. Worse, a non democratic government
on top of a democratic one. What if it becomes corrupt? An organization
like this is responsible for power and money. Lots of power and lots of
money. Is there a chance for it to be sublime and sacred? Do we really
believe that?

If this legislature gets passed without all these questions debated and
straightened is it democratic? If we do not trust the government to make
this decision on our behalf, then we do not trust the government at all.
So why have it?

This bill is not simple. It is way too complex and risky. It has to
evolve organically. Keeping it simple and slowly plugging the holes as
they occur. Anyone saying that they have an answer or a solution is being
naive or lying.

# Blame, shame & dirty is the name of the game

We are thronging in support of a person that reminds us of someone else.
But is the situation the same? Are the actions similar? Is the end result
good for us? There are several questions we need to ask ourselves when
we take a stand.

Even beyond that, we need to ask, are the politicians the only corrupt
people in India? How many of us pay for software? How many of us pay
the fine when we violate traffic rules? Do we do justice to the jobs
that we hold? A great way to take a stand against corruption is to be
incorruptible ourselves. An incorruptible populace cannot breed a corrupt
government. At least, not as corrupt a government as we have now.

Demanding that the government forego any deliberation and pass a legislature
unconditionally is unconstitutional and against the common good. The statement
quoted at the top of the page is a threat. Using non violence but threatening
violence. The responsibility does not lie only with the government.
It is also ours.

If this movement degenerates into riots and looting or worse - communal
conflict, Team Anna is responsible along with everyone that supported it
without understanding the consequences of their actions.
